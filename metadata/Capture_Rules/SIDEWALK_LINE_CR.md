######Source Databases: Update from imagery, existing planimetrics


######Description:

Interior sidewalk centerlines will be captured for all interior sidewalk polygon features but not the ROW-Sidewalk. Some or all of these centerlines will be added to the City's CSCL database. As such, these centerlines will be snapped to CSCL centerlines. CSCL will not be modified in any way (ie nodes will not be created in CSCL where these features intersect CSCL). These Interior Sidewalk Centerlines will extend beyond of the Interior Sidewalk Polygons when connecting to a CSCL feature. No attributes will be created or populated for this feature.
