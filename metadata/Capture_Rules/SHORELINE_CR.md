######Source Databases: Update from imagery, existing planimetrics

######Description:

Update significant changes (longer than 10 feet) along shorelines to reflect new
conditions.

Do NOT update when existing shoreline follows the general shape of the shoreline in the imagery but is offset due to high tide, low tide conditions.

Streams greater than 8 feet that intersect bay/ocean will be considered part of the shoreline.

Use and combine with HYDROGRAPHY Layer.
