#####Feature Code | *type*:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLAZA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*polygon*

######Source Databases: Update from imagery

######Description:

Capture/update public space and plaza. These are hard surfaced "parks" adjacent to public sidewalks or pavement edges. Where a plaza is connected to a sidewalk by steps, the steps will be considered part of the plaza polygon.

Walkways within the plaza will be part of the overall plaza polygon and NOT be considered a separate
polygon. Planters at the edge of plaza will be included as part of the plaza boundary.

Plazas cannot overlap medians or sidewalks.

The following map can be used as a guide, though it is not an exhaustive list as it only includes areas that were giving zoning benefits. http://home2.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/pops/pops_map.pdf

Additionally, potential plazas can be identified using CSCL (TRAFDIR=NV and BIKE_LANEâ‰ 1).
