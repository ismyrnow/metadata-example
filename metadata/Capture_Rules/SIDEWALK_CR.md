#####Feature Code | *type*:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROW SIDEWALK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*polygon*

######Source Databases: Update from imagery, existing planimetrics


######Description:

Update all paved sidewalks that are located within the ROW (i.e. building to building).
In areas of construction, collect along imaginary line to complete polygon. In areas where equipment is stored or installed on sidewalk, complete sidewalk.  In areas were protection or scaffolding (pedestrian protection from overhead construction) is placed over sidewalk, use existing data and do NOT update.

Sidewalks to be collected for crossing large medians or traffic islands.  Ignore openings (landscaping and trees) in sidewalk.
Large, paved open spaces in front of buildings and outside of the public ROW (may have trees and landscaping) will be included in plazas and will NOT be a sidewalk.

Snap parking lot to road edge and digitize sidewalks crossing over parking outlines for exit and entrance.  Sidewalks do not cross alleys but will be continued across driveways.

Sidewalk will be continued under bridges and overpasses if they are visible on both sides of the structure.

#####Feature Code | *type*:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERIOR SIDEWALK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*polygon*

######Source Databases: Update from imagery, existing planimetrics


######Description:

Update all interior sidewalks. The business use of this feature is to identify potential areas, outside of the public Right of Way (ROW), that could permit emergency vehicles through travel. These features will consist of hardscape (paved and other hard surfaces) sidewalks and walkways that are not along the ROW and are large enough for emergency vehicles. Since the intended purpose is one to support emergency through travel, spurs and dead-ends, such as walkways leading to a building, are not to be captured.  These features will be captured in the following areas:

1.  NYC Parks
2.  NYCHA Properties
3.  Other Residential areas
4.  Hospital campuses
5.  School campuses
6.  Federal Forts

These features will not be captured in office parks or other similar commercial areas.

Interior sidewalks will follow the same general capture rule guidelines as the rest
of the sidewalk feature class as to how they interact with the surrounding features. Sources to be used as a guide in
determining where these features exist will be: 

NYCHA Development (poly), Parks
Property (poly), CSCL Complexes (poly), Fort URLs to NYCityMap, Hospitals (point) and Schools (point). 

Regardless of the source reference data, these features will be captured for the areas mentioned above.
